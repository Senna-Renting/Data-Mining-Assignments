I first thought each line in the MovieLensData.txt file represented a data object just as the u.item file has, but after checking the amount of lines for both files I quickly found that this couldn't be the case. What did seem possible to me was that each line was an attribute, and that it contained the indices of the u.item if such an attribute was related to any of the data objects in u.item, I checked for the last index of u.item in the MovieLensData.txt file and found this to be the case."

    "In general the starwars movies that are present in the purchases, were often bought together, so a lot of association rules is contain them (probably also because they have a high support in this dataset). There were some other interesting rules as well, for example \"Toy Story\", \"Mission: Impossible\" and \"Pulp Fiction\" all were strongly associated with buying \"Star Wars\". The association rule with the highest confidence (1.0) is: $$\\textbf{The Empire Strikes Back + Return of the Jedi + Raiders of the Lost Ark} \\rightarrow \\textbf{Star Wars}$$. Most of the association rules make sense, but to buy star wars after having bought pulp fiction doesn't really seem like a normal thing to do, so this is probably due to insufficient data, or it is just a weird pattern that people tend to fall into."
