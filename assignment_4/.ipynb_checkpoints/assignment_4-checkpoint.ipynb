Upon completing the exercise you should also understand how the choice of number of clusters, distance metrics and linkage functions can impact the solutions obtained and further be able to interpret dendrograms and measures of cluster validity\n",

    "## Advised Reading and Exercise Material\n",
    "**The following reading material is recommended:**\n",

    "- Pang-Ning Tan, Michael Steinbach, and Vipin Kumar, *Introduction to Data Mining*, section 8.1-8.3 and 8.5.7\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Tools\n",
    "For this exercise you will need to load the provided *clusterPlot.py* and *clusterVal.py* scripts from the toolbox folder. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In previous exercises we considered supervised learning, i.e., we were given both input data **X** and output values **Y**. We now move on to unsupervised learning where we are only provided input data **X**. The aim is here to find common patterns in the data such as groups of observations that are similar in some sense. In this exercise we will consider two clustering approaches for unsupervised learning: *k*-means clustering and hierarchical clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.1 *k*-means clustering\n",
    "In this part of the exercise we will investigate *k*-means clustering. In *k*-means each of the data points are assigned to the cluster in closest proximity according to some measure of distance between cluster centers and data points. When the distance is given by the squared euclidian distance, the centers are also called centroids. Once the data points have been assigned, each cluster center is updated to be placed at the center of the data points that are assigned to the cluster. This continues iteratively, usually until the assignment of data points to centers no longer changes or until a maximal number of iterations is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.1.1a (0.5 point) Load the `synth1` data into python using the `loadmat` function. The `synth1` data is a Matfile loaded into Python as a dictionary; the relevant data is contained under keys `X` and `y`. Cluster the data into `K = 4` clusters using the *k*-means algorithm. Make a scatter plot of the data and the clustering using the provided `clusterPlot()` function from the toolbox. Move the legend if the position is obfuscating data.\n",

    " + In Python, you can use the function `KMeans()` from the package sklearn.cluster to compute *k*-means clustering. please read the documentation of the function, as it creates an object which you can then use for clustering.\n",
    " + Type `clusterPlot(X,clusters,centroids,y)` to plot the data and the clustering. Don't forget to import the function from the `toolbox` folder. If you are unsure about how to use the function, open the .py file in a text editor and take a look at documentation."
